This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and providing a renderItem function that returns a component that's not properly memoized.  This can lead to unexpected re-renders and performance issues, particularly when dealing with large datasets.  The issue is exacerbated when the items in the data array are objects, and the component relies on object references for comparison.
